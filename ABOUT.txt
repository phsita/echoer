ECHOER project is made for the purpose of demonstrating
client-server communication over a computer network.

As part of the project, there are two packages within it.

ECHOER is the client utility of the ECHOER project.
Client connects to the server at a specified server-address.
Upon successful connection, client can send messages to the
server. To which, server replies back with same message.

ECHOERD is the server utility of the ECHOER project.
it runs in server-mode and listens on a socket address.
It accepts connections from clients on a user-specified
network address.
Upon a successful connection, ECHOERD accepts messages from
the ECHOER client.
For every message received from client, server sends back
the same message as a response to the client (hence the
name 'ECHOER').
