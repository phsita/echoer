There are two parts of the ECHOER Project.
ECHOER is the client and ECHOERD is the server.

To compile both packages from source, you will require following dependencies -
1. Linux 2.6.3+ based operating system as the platform
2. gcc
3. gnu automake tools

Once the dependencies are met, run this below command from the project directory
on the shell to build client and server packages altogether in one go -
$ make

After this, the binaries should be compiled and available at ./bin directory

To refer help with invocation of utilities, try command argument flags -- '-h' or '--help'
